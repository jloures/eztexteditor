-   **🎨 Modern UI**: Clean, distraction-free interface with Dark/Light mode support.

## 🚀 How It Works

This editor is stateless. It does not use a backend database or local storage for the document content.

1.  **Write**: Type your markdown in the editor.
2.  **Compress & Encrypt**: The app compresses your workspace state (all tabs) and, if enabled, encrypts it with a password.
3.  **Store in URL**: The resulting data string is placed in the URL hash (`#...`).
4.  **Save/Share**: Bookmark the URL or share it. When you open it again, the app decrypts the hash and restores your exact workspace.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Quick Start
Simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

-   **New Note**: Click `+ New Note` in the sidebar.
-   **Rename Note**: Double-click a tab or click the pencil icon to rename.
-   **Encrypt**: Click the **Unlock** icon in the toolbar to set a password.
-   **Preview**: Toggle the **Eye** icon to switch between Edit and Preview modes.
-   **Export**: Click the **Download** icon to save the current tab as a `.md` file.

## 📦 Installation

## 🔒 Security

-   **Encryption**: Uses `PBKDF2` for key derivation and `AES-GCM` (256-bit) for encryption.
-   **Zero-Knowledge**: Since there is no backend, we (the developers) cannot see your data or your passwords. If you lose your password, **your data cannot be recovered**.
